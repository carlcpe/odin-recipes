This is the HTML Recipe project in The Odin Project. I've been following the program as a way to strengthen my foundations.

I skipped a lot about learning the proper basics, and doing this project would help me in learning what i've missed.

This project would show that I have learned how to do HTML boilerplates, the different HTML elements and their attributes, and a lot more.
I learned about hyperlink references, images, resizing, unordered and ordered lists, headers, paragraphs, and texts.

I also learned all about Git and GitHub and how I could write atomic commits and commits with the proper conventions.
