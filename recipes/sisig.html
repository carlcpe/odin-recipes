    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pork Sisig is a quintessential Filipino dish known for its bold flavors and crispy texture. 
        Originating from the culinary capital of the Philippines, Pampanga, this dish features 
        chopped pork, typically from the face, belly, and sometimes liver, that is boiled, grilled, 
        and then sautéed with garlic, onions, and chilies. The addition of soy sauce, vinegar, and 
        calamansi juice gives it a savory, tangy profile, while the optional inclusion of mayonnaise 
        and a raw egg stirred in at the end adds a rich, creamy dimension.</p>

    <p>Traditionally served on a sizzling plate, Pork Sisig is a favorite among Filipinos for its 
        perfect balance of textures and flavors—crispy, tender, savory, and spicy. Often enjoyed 
        as a main dish with rice or as a popular pulutan (appetizer) to accompany drinks, Sisig has 
        become a beloved staple in Filipino cuisine, celebrated for its deliciously unique and hearty appeal.</p>
